## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Download the Saved Model Weights**
The saved model weights are stored on Google Drive. Follow these steps to download and set them up:

1. Download the weights from [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bWQhAPrGmcEZF86CcyKaHbLPBZTfikOz?usp=sharing).
2. Create a directory named `saved_weights` in the root folder of this project.
3. Place the downloaded weights inside the `saved_weights` folder.

### 2. **Install Required Dependencies**
To avoid dependency conflicts, we recommend setting up a Python virtual environment. Follow these steps:

#### 2.1 **Create and Activate the Virtual Environment**  
```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.7
conda activate myenv
